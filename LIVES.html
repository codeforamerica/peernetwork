			         <p>Developed in collaboration with the City of San Francisco, New York City, and Yelp, the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/healthscores">Local Inspector Value-entry Specification</a> (LIVES) is an open data standard which allows municipalities to publish restaurant inspection information to Yelp or any other website. And now, any city can participate.</p>
			<p>Make the commitment to share your city’s restaurant health inspection scores and promote improved public health and informed decision-making. Pledge to implement the LIVES standard in your municipality in 2013.</p>

				          <h4 class="redli">Empower Citizens</h4>
				          Make valuable health department information available to your residents in a consumer-friendly format so they can make more informed decisions. LIVES can help you share this important information with the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/about">84 million unique visitors</a> who use Yelp each month.

				          <h4 class="redli">Improve Public Health</h4>
				        Transparency is good for public health outcomes. When the City of Los Angeles required that restaurants display hygiene grade cards on their entrances, studies found it led to a <a href="http://kuafu.umd.edu/~ginger/research/JEH-final.pdf">13% decrease</a> in hospitalizations due to food borne illness.

				          <h4 class="redli">Drive Economic Development</h4>
				         Opening city data lets entrepreneurs build new products and services using that data, driving job creation and economic growth. Industry forecasts predict that governments that promote open data will foster <a href="http://gov.aol.com/2012/12/05/10-predictions-for-government-it-in-2013/">25% more</a> private commercial activity in apps and services in 2013 than 2012.

			      <h1>The Program</h1>
			      <div class="top_art_cont">
							<p>The CfA Peer Network connects change agents in local government around big ideas with the potential to make government more engaged with citizens and more effective. Through events, resources, and networking opportunities, we’ll build a network of local innovators empowered to be more effective in their cities and in their careers — and drive forward our collective vision for a new kind of public service.</p>
							<p>The program will launch publicly in early 2013; If you're interested, <a data-toggle="modal" href="#app"> let us know. &#8594;</a>

    						  <h3 class="ribbon">Our Vision</h3>
    						    <p class="quote">"Peer networks are great innovators... because their open architecture allows others to build more easily on top of existing ideas, just as Berners-Lee built the Web on top of the Internet, and a host of subsequent contributors improved on Berners-Lee’s vision of the Web." — Steven B. Johnson, Future First</p>
    						    <p>The CfA Peer Network is designed to be itself a platform for surfacing new ideas and spreading them among innovators in city governments, focusing on emerging trends and what's working where. While the agenda will be set by the members, central themes we see developing include:<p>
    						      <ul class="themes">
    						        <li><strong>The Citizen Experience:</strong> How can we create interfaces to government – digital and otherwise – that are simple, beautiful, and easy to use?</li>
    						        <li><strong>Community as Capacity:</strong> How do we ask citizens for not just for  feedback to government, but for concrete help in making their communities work?</li>
    						        <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making:</strong> How can we leverage key data to optimize processes, source scarce resources, and provide continuous feedback loops?</li>
    						        <li><strong>Lean Startup Methodologies:</strong> How can we rethink approaches to procurement, instead experimenting and testing our way towards simple solutions that really work?</li>
    						      </ul>

			      <div class="top_art_cont">
				<p>Got questions? Good. Here are some answers, and we'll keep adding to the list over time. Still not sure about something? No problem.  Drop us a line (<a href="mailto:info@codeforamerica.org">email</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/codeforamerica">@codeforamerica</a>), and we'll get you squared away.</p>
			        <h2>What is the CfA Peer Network?</h2>
						<p class="answers">It’s a membership-based, peer learning community that will mobilize innovation in cities by supporting and connecting forward-thinking local government leaders across the country. The Peer Network provides  structure for collaboration and knowledge exchange between cities — supplemented by tools, information resources, professional development and training, and access to outside experts.</p>
			        <h2>What is Code for America?</h2>
						<p class="answers">Founded by <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/author/jen">Jennifer Pahlka</a> in 2009, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> is a non-profit that's trying to make government work more like the internet: more open, more efficient, and more collaborative. Code for America launched with the CfA Fellowship, an annual program, which pairs passionate technologists with innovative city governments to build new solutions to civic problems. (To learn more about the broader context of CfA's work, see Jen's recent <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/03/08/jennifer-pahlka-at-ted-video/">TED Talk</a>.)</p>
			        <h2>Who can join the Peer Network?</h2>
						<p class="answers">Membership is open to government innovators from cities and counties of all sizes. The only requirements? You work within local government, and you have a passion for civic innovation. Check out our <a href="#team">members</a> to see who's participating so far.</p>
					<h2>When can I join the Peer Network?</h2>
						<p class="answers">We’re currently in closed beta; we’ll be launching publicly in early 2013. Interested in joining? <a data-toggle="modal" href="#app">Let us know</a>, and we’ll make sure you’re the first to know when membership is open.</p>
					<h2>I don't work in government, but I want to get involved. What can I do?</h2>
						<p class="answers">Check out the Code for America <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org">Brigade</a>, our network of volunteer civic hackers across the country. There might be a Brigade in your community already, or you can start one yourself.</p>
						<p>Additionally, we'll be looking for folks from outside government with expertise in specific topic areas to serve as guest contributors and project advisors for the Peer Network  — if you're interested in participating in this capacity, <a href="mailto:lauren@codeforamerica.org">email us</a>.</p>
