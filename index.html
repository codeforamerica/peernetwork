			        <h2>What is the CfA Peer Network?</h2>
						<p class="answers">It’s a membership-based, peer learning community that will mobilize innovation in cities by supporting and connecting forward-thinking local government leaders across the country. The Peer Network provides  structure for collaboration and knowledge exchange between cities — supplemented by tools, information resources, professional development and training, and access to outside experts.</p>
			        <h2>What is Code for America?</h2>
						<p class="answers">Founded in 2009, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> (CfA) is a nonprofit collaborating with local governments to foster and facilitate innovation in cities. CfA is known for its fellowship program, which has brought tech professionals to partner with over 20 city governments to solve problems using new approaches. Through its new Accelerator and Brigade programs, CfA is connecting cities with startups and volunteers, as well as each other. For more information, watch <a href="codeforamerica.org/TED">founder Jennifer Pahlka’s TED talk</a>.</p>
			        <h2>Who can join the Peer Network?</h2>
						<p class="answers">Membership is open to government innovators from cities and counties of all sizes. The only requirements? You work within local government, and you have a passion for civic innovation.</p>
					<h2>When can I join the Peer Network?</h2>
						<p class="answers">We are currently in beta, and we’re now accepting applications for membership on a limited basis. Interested in finding our more? <a data-toggle="modal" href="#app">Let us know</a>, and we’ll be in touch with more details.</p>
					<h2>How much does it cost to join the Peer Network?</h2>
							<p class="answers">Beta members can participate free of charge during the beta period. In the future, annual membership dues will be determined on a sliding scale based on population.</p>
					<h2>I don't work in government, but I want to get involved. What can I do?</h2>
						<p class="answers">Check out the Code for America <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org">Brigade</a>, our network of volunteer civic hackers across the country. There might be a Brigade in your community already, or you can start one yourself.</p>
						<p>Additionally, we'll be looking for folks from outside government with expertise in specific topic areas to serve as guest contributors and project advisors for the Peer Network  — if you're interested in participating in this capacity, <a href="mailto:pn-staff@codeforamerica.org">email us</a>.</p>
